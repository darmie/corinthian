        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>Not unlike rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_leather">Corinthian Leather</a> the Corinthian project aims to provide more advanced UI elements for applications built with <a href="https://incubator.apache.org/cordova/">Apache Cordova</a>. Initially Cordova will target the Android platform but as time goes own we'll add support for other platforms. </p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>We think Apache Cordova is great but there are some things that it doesn't address as they are outside of it's bailiwick. One of those items is a rich UI. Sometimes building Apache Cordova applications is more difficult than it could be as it doesn't (nor shouldn't) provide UI components. The philosophy of the Corinthian project is to provide some of these UI components like contact and file pickers as well as we'll monkey punch the  and  tags so you won't have to change your HTML code when porting you application to Android.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>Right now the target is Android but over time we'll migrate these native Android UI components into JavaScript so that it will be compatible with other platforms. </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>TBD</p>
